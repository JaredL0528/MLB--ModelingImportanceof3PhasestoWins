# MLB -- Modeling the Importance of the 3 Phases to Wins
 In this project, we use an OLS model to estimate the importance of an MLB team's pitching, fielding, and batting performance during a season to their Win%.

Includes code to scrape every team's basic batting, pitching, and fielding data from BaseballReference. We also scrape the standings for each season from 2000-2020 and join that data with the team stats for those years.
